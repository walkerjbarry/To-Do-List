<!--A user must be able to add and delete a todo item, from the UI and from your storage.
-Save each todo item as an object, with a key for the todo text and an "id" key that represents a random number you can use to search it by. So, you should have an array of objects that you're saving in localStorage.
-Hint: use JavaScript localStorage to store the todos. 
-Hint: To convert an array into the string representation, you'll need JSON stringify. To convert it back to an array, you'll need JSON parse.
-Send me the project for review and get started on the next project.

You can store your Todos in an array, but keep in mind that localStorage can only store strings, so that means you'll have to convert your array of todos into a string before you can store it. And when you retrieve it, you have to convert it from a string back to an array. Those are all things you can do with JavaScript, so make sure to look those up.

Also, you can use JavaScript to add an "onclick" attribute to elements you're using JavaScript to create. This may be of note when thinking of how to delete the todo element. 
-----------------------------------------

COMPONENTS NEEDED:
items saved as objects, 
	with a key (toDo text) 
	and ID key 
		which is a random number


-----------------------------------------
My NOTES:

Needed:

Add and delete an item from the UI, and from local storage

means there must be a list on the screen that updates and removes items

must look up JavaScript localStorage

might benefit from looking up the JS Counter problem, to get the ability to add, delete items

the localStorage will be saving an array

means that items will need to be converted from array>>>string (uses JSON Stringify)
and string>>>array (uses JSON parse
to be retrieved

also looks like we will be using Math.random, and thus, likely also Math.floor
